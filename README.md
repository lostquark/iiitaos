Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to develop and validate an effective OS fingerprinting model for IoT and networked devices using machine learning.

We aim to create a hybrid fingerprinting system that combines passive and active fingerprinting techniques to:

Identify the Operating System (OS) and its specific version

Perform Vulnerability Assessment

Support Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

Project Overview
Why OS Fingerprinting?

Helps in vulnerability detection and threat mitigation

Enables network administrators to identify unauthorized or insecure devices

Supports adaptive security systems by detecting OS-level characteristics

 Dataset

We used the Nikolaitâ€™s dataset, containing around 12,000 TCP/IP packet entries, covering a wide range of attributes such as:

ip_checksum, ip_df, ip_hdr_length, ip_id, ip_mf, ip_off, ip_protocol,
ip_rf, ip_tos, ip_total_length, ip_ttl, ip_version,
tcp_ack, tcp_checksum, tcp_flags, tcp_header_length, tcp_mss,
tcp_off, tcp_options, tcp_seq, tcp_timestamp, tcp_timestamp_echo_reply,
tcp_urp, tcp_window_size

Feature Selection

We employed Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with a Random Forest Classifier (RFC) to identify the most relevant attributes for OS classification.

Selected Features:

ip_checksum

ip_id

ip_total_length

ip_ttl

tcp_checksum

tcp_off

tcp_seq

tcp_window_size

Model and Performance

Algorithm Used: Random Forest Classifier

Input Data: TCP/IP packet-level data

Performance:

Previous accuracy: 78.06%

Current model accuracy: 82.29%



ðŸš§ Limitations

Passive OS Fingerprinting Dependency â€” limited by available traffic patterns

Active Fingerprinting Speed â€” slower in large-scale scanning
